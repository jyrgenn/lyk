Table Literals
--------------

The syntax of table literals is #:(<pairs>), where <pairs> is one or
more pairs. Of each pair, the car is the key and the cdr is the
value of a table entry. If there is more than one pair with the same
key, all but one of them are silently ignored. Examples:

    #:()
    #:((#\4 . 52)(#\@ . 64)(#\[ . 91))
    #:((3 . "119")(a . b)("shoo" . 13.4))
