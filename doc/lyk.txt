Lyk â€” a Lisp yn Kotlin
======================

Like my previous attempts, mostly, this Lisp interpreter implements
a somewhat traditional form of Lisp, closer to Maclisp of Common
Lisp than to Scheme. Somehow I seem to feel close to separate
function and value properties of a symbol than to just one.

While this is far from the vast comprehensiveness and sophistication
of Common Lisp, I try to keep the names of and functionality of
builtin functions somewhat similar, if far simpler.
