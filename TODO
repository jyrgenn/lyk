Weights: Need, Want, Nice, TBD (to be decided)

  - Get the regtests going. Implies a number of things to implement
    so I can run the lingo regtest code. Or write it anew? Huh, not
    keen on that, actually. Need.

  - make desc => toString() and toString() => value? makes a lot of
    casual object printing easier or rather more descriptive. TBD.

  - Some file not found handling; currently it bombs with a Java
    exception. Need, definitely.

  - clean up the conditionals: have cond as builtin; if, when,
    unless as macros. Should not have a perceptible performance
    impact. Want, but only after the regtests.

  - For startup/preload problems: debug reader-lines? Maybe no
    longer needed. A tad difficult as the Reader does not read
    lines; would need line buffering in the stream. TBD.


  + builtin (exit &optional (exit-status 0)). Need.
