-: open; @: work in progress; +: done; *: denied;

Weights: Need, Want, Nice, TBD (to be decided), Bug

  - Get the regtests going. Implies a number of things to implement
    so I can run the lingo regtest code. Or write it anew? Huh, not
    keen on that, actually. Need.

  - dolist, dotimes without with-gensyms. Need (regtests).

  - make desc => toString() and toString() => value? makes a lot of
    casual object printing easier or rather more descriptive. TBD.

  - clean up the conditionals: have cond as builtin; if, when,
    unless as macros. Should not have a perceptible performance
    impact. Want, but only after the regtests.

  - For startup/preload problems: debug reader-lines? Maybe no
    longer needed. A tad difficult as the Reader does not read
    lines; would need line buffering in the stream. TBD.


  + Environment functions env-table, env-vars. Need.

  + *process* environment functions getenv, setenv, process-env
    (returns a table). Need. => no setenv though; environment can be
    modified for a subprocess, but not the current one.

  + listdir or whatever (directory-files pathname). Need (regtests).

    Kotlin has Path.listDirectoryEntries(), but what is a Path? It
    is an Interface, but File does not implement it, obviously, nor
    does it have a constructor (which makes sense).

    Indeed File(dirname).listDir(); contains the dirname, though.
    Have (directory-entries pathname) now.

  + defined-in property for all function symbols. Need.

  + Some file not found handling; currently it bombs with a Java
    exception. Need, definitely.

  + builtin (exit &optional (exit-status 0)). Need.

  + BUG: defined-in properties are set in flet, which they
    shouldn't.
