To build and install lyk, you need a JDK that is recent enough (I
have no idea which ones work, I use OpenJDK 21.0.3), a Kotlin JVM
compiler named kotlinc, version 1.9.22 or 2.0.0, etags (as of a
current GNU Emacs installation).

The OSes that work for me are macOS 14.5 (Sonoma) and Ubuntu 22.04.

You may want to edit src/Makefile to set INSTALLBASE; the default is
`/opt/w21/`. Then it is

  $ cd src && make new install

Have fun!
